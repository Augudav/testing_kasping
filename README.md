This dashboard was built on the code shared by [Danny Groves Ph.D.](https://twitter.com/DrDanobi), link to the original [github repository](https://github.com/GrovesD2/market_monitor_trend_dash/tree/main#readme). The idea for the Trend Predictor was also built on "Dr. Danobi's" code and concept.




## What is Power law
The concept that the price of some cryptocurrencies is well explained by the [Power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law) relationship was proposed in 2018 by [Giovanni Santostasi](https://twitter.com/Giovann35084111) on Reddit and has recently started to gain popularity on X, due to its accuracy in predicting Bitcoin's price. This law seems to work very well for KAS too, although we have a much shorter price history for it.

## Past Power Law
This chart shows the current best prediction for each day in the past with the info available at that time.

## Future Power Law
Check the expected future price with the current power law parameters.

## Risk Visualizer
Propriety metric on how far away from the expected value the price is trading. Not repainted (!). To visualize the current risk, code from [Bitcoin Raven](https://github.com/BitcoinRaven/Bitcoin-Risk-Metric-V2) was used.

## Trend predictor
Random forrest classifier trying to predict how likely it is, that price of KAS will close above 20 SMA in 5 days.
